Tired of spending hours debugging and wrestling with code quality issues? 😩  
I felt that pain too. That's why I built **CyberLint_AI** — an AI-powered code review tool that provides instant, intelligent feedback to help you write better, error-free code.

## 🧠 The Problem

Developers often spend valuable time hunting down bugs 🐞 and optimizing code after the fact. This slows down development cycles and leads to frustrating delays.

---

## ✅ The Solution

**CyberLint_AI** leverages the power of the **Google Gemini API** to analyze your code in real time and provide:

- 🔍 **Instant feedback** on bugs and bad practices  
- ✨ **Suggestions** to improve code structure and quality  
- 🚀 **Productivity boosts** by reducing time spent on manual reviews
